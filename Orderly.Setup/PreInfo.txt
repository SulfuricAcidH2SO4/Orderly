Once the installation is complete Windows will block the program from running as it cannot recognize its signature. Unfortunately this is because buying a certificate is not really feasible for a solo developer therefore I cannot guarantee Windows that this executable is safe. 
When the error occurs you can just click "More Info > Run Anyway"

Thank you for your understanding!
