## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any sensitive security issue you may have encountered you can submit a report explaining the issue, how to replicate it and, if you have any, suggestions to solve the issue, at <a href="mailto:app.orderly@gmail.com">app.orderly@gmail.com</a>.

Needless to say, please keep this to very sensitive issues only. Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/SulfuricAcidH2SO4/Orderly/issues">issues tab</a> on Github to report any other bug.

Thanks!
